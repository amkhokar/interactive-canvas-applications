## Canvas Experimentation
# Ahmed Khokar

Several of the demos are experimental, and for fullest functionality I would suggest bongoMusic or bongoFreeze. Visual and auditory immersion are my lofty goals for a masterful user experience. Any feedback is appreciated! (If Any of the links are down, simply clone any of the repositories and open in the index.html page in your browser).
